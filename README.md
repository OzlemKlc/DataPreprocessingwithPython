# DataPreprocessingwithPython
This project aims to perform data preprocessing using Python.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to implement data preprocessing steps using the Python programming language. The project content includes these steps:
- Filling in missing values.
- Detection and correction of anomalies.
- Feature selection with Chi-Square (Chi2) method.
- Label Encoding and conversion of categorical attributes to binary string Dummy Encoding.
- Model training with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and implementation of different types (eg LTSM , SVM ,FNN).

## Used technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn libraries, Matplotlib
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
